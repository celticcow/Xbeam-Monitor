Problem starting 7.13.08 : Discovered 07.14.08
Started seeing CPU on ACluster on both zmd chassis at 100% ... BCluster followed a day or so later.  Disabled daemon on chassis and started debugging.  CPU core's show correct values of < 3% used but cpu average is 100%

7.15.08
Issue is caused by total cpu being the sum of the two cores.  The average idle from /proc/stat is more than a long int in C can store. C truncates the value.  When we try to add the total0 and total1 value we end up with a negative value as a result

unsigned int    4      32                0 -> +4,294,967,295
long int        4      32   -2,147,483,648 -> +2,147,483,647

converted values to unsigned int's and used 

parts[i] = strtoul(temp,NULL,0);

to convert to unsigned int instead of 

parts[i] = atoi(temp);

in the void tokencpuline function

07.28.08

Booted up, readings nothing for fw conn, negative for CPU
need to report error for these conditions

11.03.08

Memory readings does not seem to be reading correct values.  Chassis alarms are going off but memory graphs and readings do not seem to be changing that much (seen on G Cluster Chassis)

09.11.09

Need to add VRRP checks

in 8.0 a show vrrp will work, in later version need show vrrp detail-status

need to add in show redundancy-interface  returns for interface failures

Issue with Memory checks and XOS 8.5 
there is no longer a memory line in /proc/meminfo

Saw issue with grep field in memory in 8.5 code

vs

ACluster_1 (zmd1): root$ cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i 'MemTotal'
MemTotal:      2054524 kB

09.22.10
Issues with total value when adding up all 8 cores.  This caused issues with over flowing an unsigned long
6874909776 was result
4294967295 is max of unsigned long

had to change to unsigned long long int
